      <h1>About My Anthro Size Diff Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        I LOVE size diff! I designed this calculator to help explain/show what I
        meant by "species based scaling" Basically, you have an anthro height!
        like 5'10" or 210cm. I use this value as input, and then scale it
        according to the percentiles and heights of other species. Im not so
        much scaling you but scaling you by your species! For example.. If you
        were a male with 90th percentile height (like 6'1") then I'd perform a
        regression to scale you against the species of your choice with that
        same height! This works for any species, and the data is stored in yaml
        files like such
      </p>

      <div class="yaml-display">
        <pre>{{ yaml_content }}</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Thats how it works! Thanks for using my calculator and I hope it suits
        you well! (You can also of course, disable species scaling by just NOT
        checking the "Scale By Species" box!)
